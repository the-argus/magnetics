# magnetics

Puzzle platformer with magnets. Made with WebGL via PixiJS.

I originally made this as a class project. PixiJS, the WebGL framework we were
taught to use, does not include any utilities for game physics. To get around
that, I wrote the physics system for this game myself, and it's the element I am
most proud of at time of writing. Most of the physics code can be found in the
``physics-engine.js`` and ``math.js`` files.
