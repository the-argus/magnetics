      <h2>My Process</h2>
      <p>
        I started with the proposals, which you can find at
        <a
          href="https://people.rit.edu/ifm1110/235/git/projects/11_18_22_project3_proposal_OLD/"
          >https://people.rit.edu/ifm1110/235/git/projects/11_18_22_project3_proposal_OLD/</a

        and

      </p>
      <p>
        I began the project by spawning a PIXI sprite and making it move
        downwards all the time. Then I wrote an AABB overlap function. Then I
        instantiated a floor sprite and began watching the talk listed in my
        sources. After applying what I learned, I had a system which could
        handle vertical, downwards collisions (so walls and ceilings didn't
        work) and was extremely bouncy. I clearly had messed something up, but I
        decided to put it off since it was somewhat servicable. I implemented
        the magnets, at this point fully subscribing to an entity component
        system architechture. I managed to write an algorithm for getting
        normals, too, so collisions with walls and ceilings could now occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point I submitted to the feedback party. There was no reset
        button, and the incessant bouncing was a big issue. I proceeded to spend
        most of my time post-feedback on getting the physics right, which turned
        out to be easy by applying the theory I knew, instead of trying to copy
        and paste the equations on Catto's slides that I didn't fully
        understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I spent the last few days before submission adding the goal,
        fancy graphical filters, cleaning up the code, and adding more
        documentation. As a finishing touch, I made magnets pulse when active.

          - A talk from the creator of Box2D, Erin Catto himself.

      <h2>How I Met The Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Code Formatting:</strong> Code is formatted according to
          <a href="https://standardjs.com/index.html">standardjs</a> with eslint
          used as the actual formatter. Additionally, every file contains at
          least some commenting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ES6 Class: </strong> All of the files in the "objects" folder
          contain classes (children of GameObject) built using an entity
          component system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation: </strong> hmmmm not sure if I did this one or
          not just not sure hmmmmm
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Error Prevention: </strong> I don't have a single try/catch in
          my code. However, I challenge you to get it to throw an error! It's
          pretty well tested, as far as four or five people playing it for a few
          minutes in front of me can.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimized Images: </strong> My images aren't particularly
          optimized: they're png format (could easily be jpeg) and 1024x1024
          (could probably be smaller without sacrificing much visual quality.
          However, there are a grand total of three (3) images, so it's not
          exactly negatively affecting the experience.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Features You Should Notice</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The player has reduced movement control while in the air.</li>
        <li>Friction is different while in the air and on the ground.</li>
        <li>When you land on the ground, you don't go through it.</li>
        <li>Seriously, that last one is difficult to do accurately</li>
